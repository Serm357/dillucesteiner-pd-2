              At Diluc Steiner, we revolutionize healthcare through AI to combat
              antimicrobial resistance (AMR), education, and awareness. Our
              advanced technology provides rapid, accurate insights, enabling
              early detection and precise treatment plans. We also believe that
              informed communities and proactive measures are key to preventing
              the spread of AMR from animals to humans, the environment to
              humans, and between humans.
