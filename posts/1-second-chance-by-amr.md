### George Semakula's Story of Overcoming a Multidrug-Resistant Infection

This case report details the successful treatment of a complex lower-extremity infection caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria in a patient with a history of trauma. The case highlights the challenges of treating MDR infections and the potential role of novel experimental antibiotics.

**Keywords:** Multidrug-resistant bacteria, Acinetobacter baumannii, Cefiderocol, Lower extremity infection, Amputation

### The Threat of MDR Bacteria

Nosocomial infections caused by MDR bacteria pose a significant threat to global health. These infections are associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs.
**Acinetobacter baumannii** is a particularly concerning MDR pathogen due to its extensive antibiotic resistance profile. Treatment options for A. baumannii infections are often limited, and amputation may be necessary in severe cases.

### A Challenging Wound Infection

A 57-year-old male with a history of a left ankle fracture sustained during a mugging incident presented with a chronic wound infection. Microbiological analysis revealed the presence of MDR A. baumannii along with two other bacterial species. Due to the extensive antibiotic resistance profile, traditional treatment options were deemed inadequate.

### Novel Antibiotic Offers Hope

Following a comprehensive evaluation, the patient received compassionate use approval for **cefiderocol**, a novel investigational antibiotic with activity against MDR bacteria. The patient underwent a multidisciplinary treatment approach, including surgical debridement, muscle flap reconstruction, and prolonged intravenous administration of cefiderocol for four months.

### Regaining Mobility and Avoiding Amputation

The patient demonstrated a complete clinical and microbiological response to treatment. He regained functional mobility and was discharged from inpatient care for ongoing physical therapy. Notably, amputation was avoided.

### The Importance of New Antibiotics

This case report underscores the challenges associated with treating MDR infections. It also highlights the potential life-saving role of novel experimental antibiotics like cefiderocol. Continued research and development of new antibiotics are crucial to combat the increasing threat of MDR pathogens.

### A Case for Continued Development

This case report demonstrates the successful treatment of a complex lower-extremity infection caused by MDR A. baumannii with cefiderocol. This case emphasizes the need for continued development and access to novel antibiotics to address the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance.
