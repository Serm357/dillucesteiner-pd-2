### Oxford-led study shows how AI can detect antibiotic resistance in as little as 30 minutes

To mark World Antimicrobial Awareness Week, researchers supported by the
Oxford Martin Programme on Antimicrobial Resistance Testing at the
University of Oxford have reported advances towards a novel and rapid antimicrobial susceptibility test that can return results within as little as 30
minutes - significantly faster than current gold-standard approaches.

In their study published in Communications
Biology, the team used a combination of
fluorescence microscopy and artificial intelligence
(AI) to detect antimicrobial resistance (AMR). This
method relies on training deep-learning models to
analyse bacterial cell images and detect structural
changes that may occur in cells when they are
treated with antibiotics. The method was shown to
be effective across multiple antibiotics, achieving at
least 80% accuracy on a per-cell basis.

The researchers say their model could be used to
identify whether cells in clinical samples are
resistant to a range of a wide variety of antibiotics in
the future.

Co-author of the paper Achillefs Kapanidis,
Professor of Biological Physics and Director of the
Oxford Martin Programme on Antimicrobial
Resistance Testing, said: ‘Antibiotics that stop the
growth of bacterial cells also change how cells look
under a microscope, and affect cellular structures
such as the bacterial chromosome. Our AI-based
approach detects such changes reliably and rapidly.
Equally, if a cell is resistant, the changes we selected
are absent, and this forms the basis for detecting
antibiotic resistance.’

The researchers tested their method on a range of
clinical isolates of E. coli, each with varying levels of
resistance to the antibiotic ciprofloxacin. The
deep-learning models were able to detect antibiotic
resistance reliably and at least 10 times faster than
established state-of-the art clinical methods
considered to be gold standard.

The team hopes to continue developing their
method so that it becomes faster and more scalable
for clinical use, as well as adapting its usage for
different types of bacteria and antibiotics.

According to the Global Research on Antimicrobial
Resistance (GRAM) Project – a partnership
involving the University – almost 1.3 million people
died in 2019 due to AMR.

Current testing methods rely on growing bacterial
colonies in the presence of antibiotics. However,
such tests are slow, often requiring several days to
understand how resistant bacteria are to a range of
antibiotics
